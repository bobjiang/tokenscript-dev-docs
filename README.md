# Overview

TokenScript is is a tokenization standard from the [Smart Token Labs team](https://smarttokenlabs.com/) that introduces a programmable interface so any token can read and write to both a blockchain smart contract and a website or web service. More info refer to [TokenScript.org](https://www.tokenscript.org/).

Smart Tokens are tokens compatible with [ERC-5169](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5169).
